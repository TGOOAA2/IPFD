Code for the paper
Statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.3.2) and the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (RAP). Most of the code should be run on DNX. The analyses included survival analysis with the survival package, restricted cubic spline analysis with the rms package, causal mediation analysis with the mediation package, and MR with the TwoSampleMR package. A two-sided p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant unless otherwise specified.
